---

* [HADOOP-13588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13588) | *Major* | **ConfServlet should respect Accept request header**

Conf HTTP service should set response's content type according to the Accept header in the request.


---

* [HADOOP-14260](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14260) | *Major* | **Configuration.dumpConfiguration should redact sensitive information**

<!-- markdown -->
Configuration.dumpConfiguration no longer prints out the clear text values for the sensitive keys listed in `hadoop.security.sensitive-config-keys`. Callers can override the default list of sensitive keys either to redact more keys or print the clear text values for a few extra keys for debugging purpose.
